Throughout my life I've acquired many interests, hobbies, goals, and images of myself. I'm interested in computer hardware, adventures outside my city, anime, different cultures, and shoes. My hobbies are watching anime and movies (except horror), DIY projects, volleyball, eating delicious food, listening to any type of music, shopping, and spending time with my family and friends. My <b>goals</b> as of now are to graduate with a job ready in place, travel at least once to twice a year after one year of saving, and to make my family proud of me. In the past, my image was an athlete. Then it <i>changed</i> <u>to</u> be a computer engineer because my mother was one. Now my image is to work for a professional company in the IT deapartment. In the future, I imagine myself being a manager over ten to twenty people in the IT department. Since I've been in college, I have met so many people and made so many memories. I'm in two organizations: Student Bonfire and Carter G. Woodson Black Awareness Committee (WBAC). I voluteer in The Big Event and as a mentor in the Aggie Familia/AFAM program. Overall this is just a breif summary of me that scratches the surface of my life.
