	Alright, to start things off about me I will mention seven facts that you can notice from looking at my home page. 1) My faovrite colors are purple and blue. 2) I'm a student at <a href="www.tamu.edu">Texas A&M University</a>. 3) I'm in my undergraduate years as a senior. 4) I'm a proud African American female. 5) I'm passionate about technology. 6) I don't have <a href="www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/what-does-20-20-vision-mean">20/20 vision</a>, which is okay because my glasses are apart of my accessories. 7) I like the number 7.
